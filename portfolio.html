<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. Before we start I would like you to know that I coded this entirely  from scratch
   and pushed to the web using <a id="ghpages" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which is a free website hosting
    repository data base that allows you to access your projects in real time with
    <a id="atomlink" href="https://atom.io/">a bunch of free open-source text editors.</a>
Anyway, this is my portfolio and holds the greatest academic acheivments of my middle school career. Enjoy!</p>
