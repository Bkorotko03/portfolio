<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. Before we start I would like you to know that I coded this entirely  from scratch
   and pushed to the web using <a id="ghpages" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which is a free website hosting
    repository data base that allows you to access your projects in real time with
    <a id="atomlink" href="https://atom.io/">a bunch of free open-source text editors.</a>
Anyway, this is my portfolio and holds the greatest academic acheivments of my middle school career. Enjoy! (Thank's to Mrs. Megahan for proof-reading my spelling and grammer!)</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a 12 year old at BPMS in the 7th grade. I like to code, play golf and basketball, and swim in my pool. I'm 5'3" and still growing. School is a pain and so is Javascript but we all have to bear in there.<img id="batface" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a1/25/bd/a125bd16feccdb45207d1b41e4d69f8f.jpg"/>
